    # It would be great to have this as a separate workflow triggered by the release event,
    # but GitHub Actions does not execute workflows if the release has been generated by another workflow.
    # Reference: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/25281
    # The only alternative would be executing it with a workflow_call trigger,
    # but taking into account that this is the single time we would be doing so, it would be a little overkill.
